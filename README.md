# **Paint (CLI)**

**Type:** Console App · **Tech Stack:** C (ANSI), CLI · **Status:** Archived

## **Overview**
A minimal command-line "paint" program built for **COMP1511**, featuring a simple toolset and an ASCII canvas; the project that got me hooked on programming.

## **Features**

* Command-driven drawing on a text grid.
* Basic tools (e.g., place/erase characters, clear canvas).
* Lightweight, single-file style, easy to compile and run.

## **Purpose**
Uploaded for permanent archival; a small but formative step from game scripting to systems programming.
