# Paint Implementation in C with CLI

This was a basic project for my introduction to computer science course (COMP1511). This was actually one of the projects that made me fall in love with computer programming, as up to this point I was only making games in Minecraft with commands and hosting servers.

There is very little to this project beyond adding simple tools, but I am uploading it here in order to archive it permanently.
